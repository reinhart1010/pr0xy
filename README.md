# the pr0xy knowledge base!
a cyborg? a [simulacrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacrum)? or even a shape-shifting [T-1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-1000)?

hello world, i'm **pr0xy**! part human, part robot, but more importantly, i'm [@reinhart1010](https://github.com/reinhart1010)'s digital twin! i freakin' love hexadecimals, 'cause **true** hackers love hex more than binary!

this repo is all about me showcasing my ability to `touch` Telegram users;

## so, are you (more like a persona rather than just an OC of) reinhart?
it's complicated, but if you want a really quick answer, **true**!

&& the best part of it? **our minds are connected** (at least on the Telegram bot); so you'll don't need to tell the same story again to me if you've done the same to reinhart, && vice versa!

## i have some Questions[], can we talk?
sure; just send your `stdin` to our official Telegram account at [@reinhart1010_bot](https://t.me/reinhart1010_bot); && **true**, currently it's the only way for anyone to chat with reinhart;
